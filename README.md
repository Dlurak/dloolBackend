# Dlool - Digital Homework Book

Dlool is the digital version of a homework book.

---

Classical homework books have many problems.
A lot of people who use tablets in school do not have notebooks but a homework book is still needed.
Here are some problems they have and how Dlool solves them:

| Problem                                    | Solution                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Everyone in a class writes down the same   | Dlool is collaborative, all entries from one class are available in one class. |
| They are not very good for the environment | Dlool is digital, no paper is needed.                                          |
| They are not very practical                | Dlool is available on all devices.                                             |
| Entries are not very structured            | Dlool has a structured entry system.                                           |
| When you lose your homework book           | Dlool is digital, you can't lose it.                                           |
| Every year you need a new homework book    | Dlool can be used for multiple years.                                          |
